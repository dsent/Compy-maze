-- core_editor.lua

-- The command-line editor flow shared by every program:
-- prompt, submit, validate, run, and re-arm. The app
-- supplies before_run() (what to do once a program
-- validates) and finish_run() (what a finished run means).

-- Macros (editor X=... sequences and recorded keyboard
-- macros) carry across levels through a per-level base.
-- Each editor run rebuilds the table from that base, so a
-- definition deleted from the program is dropped; only
-- carried base bindings survive a restart.

function clone_macros(src)
  local t = { }
  for k, v in pairs(src) do
    t[k] = v
  end
  return t
end

-- before_run() is supplied by the app and called by
-- start_program once a program validates: the maze resets
-- the level, draw does nothing (the trail persists, the
-- robot continues). The core names it but never defines
-- it.

-- Editor input processing

-- The editor runs the whole program from the start each
-- time. A miss or crash shows a modal that waits for Tab
-- (see draw_failed); a syntax error keeps the editor open
-- and shows its message on this prompt so the child fixes
-- it in place.

function input_prompt()
  if GS.invalid then
    return GS.invalid.msg
  end
  return "Commands:"
end

-- Submitting is an event: the runtime calls
-- on_text_entered with the entered text.

function submit_program(text)
  start_program(text)
end

-- Up at the first-line boundary recalls the last program,
-- but only when one exists. Down at the last-line boundary
-- does nothing, so recall stays lossless. Ordinary cursor
-- motion inside the program is left to the widget.

  if direction ~= "up" or not GS.program then

  compy.input.set_text(string.lines(GS.program))
end

-- The prompt is written only where it genuinely changes:
-- arming a level, rejecting a program, and ending a run.
-- Watching for a change instead would mean remembering the
-- previous value to compare against.
--
-- show() only shows: over an already-shown widget it is
-- ignored and cannot change the prompt. Reconfigure is what
-- changes a live widget, and the text is set separately.
--
-- "Widget" is compy.input's own name for it; this repo's own
-- prose calls the same thing the command field. Comments
-- written here on the input branch use the platform's word.

-- Still a poll, and the game's own question rather than the
-- editor's: has the queue drained? Nothing raises an event
-- for an animation ending.
--
-- The widget comes back here because this is the moment the
-- run ends -- once, not once per frame. Which runs get it
-- back is finish_run's decision, read from what it leaves
-- behind: a win starts an animation, a miss drops
-- ctrl_update, and a crash does neither -- that is the case
-- the child edits and retries from.
